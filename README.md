# SingletonPatternExmaples

Singleton is a design pattern that tells us that we can create only one instance of a class and that instance can be accessed globally.

This is one of the basic types of design pattern. It makes sure that the class acts as a single source of entry for all the consumer components that want to access this state. In other words, it provides a common entry point for using global state.

So a singleton class should be one which:

Ensures that it creates only one instance of the class
Provides a global access point to the state.
Makes sure that the instance is only created the first time.
